Summary of recent articles on the electricity market and electricity prices:
The article discusses the recent increase in electricity prices in Finland, particularly in the autumn season. According to the Finnish Energy Market Authority, the price of electricity has increased by 20% compared to the same period last year. The cause of this increase is attributed to the rising cost of electricity production, primarily due to the increase in the price of coal and other fuels used in power generation.\n\nThe article also mentions that the futures market for electricity indicates a further increase in prices in the coming months. According to the halvinsähkösopimus.fi website, the average price of electricity in Finland has increased by 4.50 euros per kilowatt-hour compared to last year's average price. The price increase is believed to be caused by the Baltic connector gas pipeline's damage, which has resulted in a shortage of electricity supply.\n\nThe article quotes Pekka Salomaa, the CEO of Energy Market Finland, as saying that the price increase is expected to continue until the end of 2024. He believes that the price increase is due to the normalization of electricity prices after a period of low prices. Salomaa also mentions that the price increase in Finland is similar to what has happened in Germany, where the price increase is believed to be caused by the same factors.\n\nThe article concludes by stating that the increase in electricity prices is expected to have a significant impact on households and businesses in Finland, particularly those that rely heavily on electricity for their operations.
